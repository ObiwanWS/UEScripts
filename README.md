A collection of Batch Scripts to help Unreal Engine developers with mundane tasks.

# Git
The Git folder contains useful scripts for projects hosted on a Git repository. The scripts there assume this repository has been added to your project as a submodule. To do so, execute "git submodule add https://github.com/ObiwanWS/UnrealScripts.git Scripts" without the quotation marks from the root folder of your project (Same folder as the .uproject file).
