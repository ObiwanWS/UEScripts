# UnrealScripts
A collection of Batch Scripts to help Unreal Engine developers with mundane tasks. The Scripts here need to be located on a folder inside the root folder of your project (Same folder as the .uproject file) to work. Usually "MyProject/Scripts".

# Git
The Git folder contains useful scripts for projects hosted on a Git repository. The scripts there assume this repository has been added to your project as a submodule. To do so, execute "git submodule add https://github.com/ObiwanWS/UnrealScripts.git Scripts" from the root folder of your Unreal project without the quotation marks.
